# Real-Time-Privacy-Shield
Our objective is to develop the Real-Time Privacy Shield, an accessible and open-source tool that automates the de-identification of sensitive information in live video streams. This solution aims to fundamentally shift the paradigm of data privacy from a reactive, after-the-fact process to a proactive, design-first principle. By leveraging AI to instantly detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) like faces and license plates, we want to empower individuals and organizations to protect privacy without sacrificing the value of their visual data.
